# Deployment Guide

## Option B: React/Vercel Quiz - Ready for Deployment! ðŸš€

### Local Testing âœ…
- âœ… Build successful 
- âœ… Dev server running at http://localhost:3000
- âœ… All components rendering correctly
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passing
- âœ… Modern responsive design with animations

### Next Steps for Deployment

#### 1. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project directory
cd "D:\Projects\OneDrive\Desktop\Coding_projects\Spree_Survey"
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project? No
# - What's your project's name? spree-style-quiz
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Want to override settings? No
```

#### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

After deployment, set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

**ActiveCampaign Settings:**
- `AC_API_KEY`: Your ActiveCampaign API key
- `AC_BASE_URL`: Your ActiveCampaign base URL (e.g., `https://your-account.api-us1.com`)

**Custom Field IDs (get these from ActiveCampaign):**
- `AC_FIELD_PRIMARY_ARCHETYPE`: Field ID for primary archetype 
- `AC_FIELD_SECONDARY_ARCHETYPE`: Field ID for secondary archetype
- `AC_FIELD_QUIZ_RESULT`: Field ID for full result description
- `AC_FIELD_QUIZ_DATE`: Field ID for quiz completion date

#### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)

Set up a custom domain like `quiz.spreewithme.com`:
- Go to your Vercel project settings
- Add domain under "Domains" 
- Update your DNS records as instructed

### ActiveCampaign Setup Required

Before going live, create these custom fields in ActiveCampaign:

1. **Settings > Fields > Create Field**
2. **Field Types:**
   - Primary Archetype: Text field
   - Secondary Archetype: Text field  
   - Quiz Result: Text area field
   - Quiz Date: Date field
3. **Note the Field IDs** and add them to Vercel environment variables
